# python-hangman-challenge
Hangman Game - Task 1 of Code Alpha Internship A Python-based Hangman game created as part of Task-1 during my internship at Code Alpha. The game allows users to guess letters in a word with six attempts. This project enhanced my skills in Python, including loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
